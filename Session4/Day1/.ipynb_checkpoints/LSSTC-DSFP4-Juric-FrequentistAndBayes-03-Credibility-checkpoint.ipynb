    "For an example of a situation in which the frequentist confidence interval and the Bayesian credibility region *do not* overlap, I'm going to turn to an example given by E.T. Jaynes, a 20th century physicist who wrote extensively on statistical inference in Physics.  In the fifth example of his *Confidence Intervals vs. Bayesian Intervals* ([pdf](http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/confidence.pdf)), he considers a truncated exponential model. Here is the problem, in his words:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A device will operate without failure for a time $\\theta$ because of a protective chemical inhibitor injected into it; but at time $\\theta$ the supply of the chemical is exhausted, and failures then commence, following the exponential failure law. It is not feasible to observe the depletion of this inhibitor directly; one can observe only the resulting failures. From data on actual failure times, estimate the time $\\theta$ of guaranteed safe operation..."

    "\"Now, I should point out that I am certainly not the first person to state things this way, or even this strongly. The Physicist [E.T. Jaynes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Thompson_Jaynes) was known as an ardent defender of Bayesianism in science; one of my primary inspirations for this post was his 1976 paper, *Confidence Intervals vs. Bayesian Intervals* ([pdf](http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/confidence.pdf)). More recently, statistician and blogger [W.M. Briggs](http://wmbriggs.com/) posted a diatribe on arXiv called [*It's Time To Stop Teaching Frequentism to Non-Statisticians*](http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2590) which brings up this same point. It's in the same vein of argument that [Savage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Jimmie_Savage), [Cornfield](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Cornfield), and other outspoken 20th-century Bayesian practitioners made throughout their writings, talks, and correspondance.\n",
    "\n",
    "So should you ever use confidence intervals at all? Perhaps in situations (such as analyzing gambling odds) where multiple data realizations are the reality, frequentism makes sense. But in most scientific applications where you're concerned with what one particular observed set of data is telling you, **frequentism simply answers the wrong question**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Edit, November 2014: to appease several commentors, I'll add a caveat here. The unbiased estimator $\\bar{x}$ that we used above is just one of many possible estimators, and it can be argued that such estimators [are not always the best choice](http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0206006). Had we used, say, the Maximum Likelihood estimator or a sufficient estimator like $\\min(x)$, our initial misinterpretation of the confidence interval would not have been as obviously wrong, and may even have fooled us into thinking we were right. But this does not change our central argument, which involves the question frequentism asks. Regardless of the estimator, **if we try to use frequentism to ask about parameter values given observed data, we are making a mistake**. For some choices of estimator this mistaken interpretation may not be as manifestly apparent, but it is mistaken nonetheless.*\""
